Hi, I'm Rahul, a Machine Learning Engineer at DoorDash. I live in Sunnyvale, CA. In my previous life(s), I did my Masters in CS from University of Massachusetts Amherst and even before that, I was a Software Engineer at Microsoft Research.

When I am not doing ML stuff, you can find me doing yoga, reading novels or just taking a walk with Spotify on. I am also an avid cricket/soccer fan, and a huge supporter of Chennai Super Kings and Manchester United.

I've recently started blogging and intend to write on a variety of technical and non-technical stuff.
