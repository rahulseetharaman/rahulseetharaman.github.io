A collection of quotes that I relate to

> [!quote] A mind at peace is a magnet for miracles.

> [!quote] I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.

> [!quote] My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.

> [!quote] When you feel you hate the world, eat. When you feel the world hates you, sleep. When you feel you hate yourself, shower.

> [!quote] Solitude is strength; to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness. The man who needs a mob to nerve him is much more alone than he imagines.

> [!quote] Well done is better than well said.

> [!quote] Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new.

> [!quote] Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping that your enemies will die because of it.
