Today I was in Yoga class (today's class was called Slow Flow), which involves holding poses for a longer time. On a particularly lazy Sunday morning, this can get very strenous. 
When I was halfway through the Yoga class, at 12:30 PM, my body and mind were literally begging me to stop the class and run home. I persisted and told myself, eh, it's 30 mins give or take, why not just flow through it and let it pass ? As time passed, my body became so relaxed and peaceful.
That's when I realized not all pain is bad. Sometimes pain is necessary to bring out the best in you. It takes pain to break free of shackles, it takes pain to build the dream body, and so on. I moved to California in Aug 2024, with the first two years here in the US spent in grad school at Amherst, MA for my masters. While in Amherst, I used to get lonely a lot, and thorughout my two years, I just couldn't find myself a social group to hang out with. It made me very bitter and angry at the universe and God and what not. 

Sometimes God puts you in a state of pain, (in this case loneliness) to get in touch with yourself, and listen to what your soul really wants. In my case, my dream was to 

1. Become an ML Engineer
2. Go to a big company 

And later on, a third was added

3. Work in California, specifically in the Bay Area

My loneliness and lack of opportunities to party and socialize actually allowed me to get in touch and spend time with my innermost self, to find out what is it that I really wanted. 2022 was the first time I had moved from the comfort zone of my home and parental care. Being alone with myself allowed me to process my needs, dreams, desires and refine them as time went by - none of which would have happened had I settled into the comfort zone of a social group, fallen into group think and did things just to fit in, while forgetting my dreams and desires. 

Right now, I work as an ML Engineer at Doordash (top food delivery company in the US) and work out of Sunnyvale, CA. As I stretch my legs and move through pain staking yoga poses, I am grateful for the pain and the person life has shaped me into. 

There is a quote I am reminded of from a famous detergent advertisement.
