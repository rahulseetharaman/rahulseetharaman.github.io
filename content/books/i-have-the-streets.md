I recently read cricketer R Ashwin's book [I Have the Streets, a Kutti Cricket Story](https://www.amazon.in/Have-Streets-Kutti-Cricket-Story/dp/0670094749). I found it to be a very enjoyable read - with a vivid description of 90s Chennai, PSBB schools, cricket, and how an entire family, a middle class household in Chennai, innovated, experimented and created an ecosystem and ultimately set the stage for Ashwin to succeed as a cricketer. The book has vivid references to [Mankading](https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ipl/faqs/what-is-mankading-non-striker-run-out-mcc-rules-laws-ipl-2023-spirit-of-the-game/article66628699.ece), how we met his wife Prithi, [the carrom ball](https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/112288/how-ashwin-developed-his-carrom-ball) and so on.
